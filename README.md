# Map-Reduce-program-to-implement-Inverted-Index-in-Hadoop
This project implemented the concept of Inverted Index using Map Reduce in Hadoop environment.  It deals with reading a total 250 files containing authors and their published books using Hadoop Streaming. Mapper then splits the lines to words for each author and sorts it to feed it into the reducer. The Reducer program would then give authors as keys and the frequency of words used by each author as their values.  This program would give an idea on the different genre of books written by authors.  The concept of inverted index is a central component  of a typical  search engine indexing algorithm.
